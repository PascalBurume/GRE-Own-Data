The Analytical Writing section, which assesses critical thinking and analytical writing skills, is always presented first. This is followed by Verbal Reasoning, which measures reading comprehension and vocabulary, and Quantitative Reasoning, which assesses basic math skills and the ability to analyze data and draw conclusions. The test is approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes long, including short breaks.

It's beneficial to practice under timed conditions and review scored sample essays to understand the scoring criteria.

Practice answering a variety of question types, such as reading comprehension, text completion, and sentence equivalence questions, to develop strategies for quickly identifying correct answers. Reviewing explanations for practice questions can also provide insights into effective strategies and common pitfalls.
